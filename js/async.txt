0 -Why we're using async programming, explain
  - because when we do network call , so response time of
   that call is prefine, it depends on multiple aspect
   like:  depend on network
          depend on size of data
          depend on server


1- What is Async programming & how does it works
    - in js for every program exicution context is created

2- How browser handles async code
  - whenever async task ancounter then on the basis of priority
  it will goto call back queue or micro task queue
  *** Note: promises has higher priority then call back async
   also if any task taking more time to complete and other
   task is ready to exicute then event loop take that task into
   call back. 

3- What is Micro task queue
   - micro task queue contains promises. 
4- What is callback or macro task queue
   callback queue- it contains call back async functions.
5- What is event loop
   - event loop is part of browser, and it check call stack
   , mirco and call back queue ,and take task from queue to
    stack after sync code code exicution
6- How event loop handle the async code execution
7- Is event loop single or multi threaded
- single threaded
8- Which one is having more priority microtask or callback queue & why
   micro task exicution. becuase promises has more priority the 
   call back functions
9- What is a promise
   - Promise is non blocking , which help use to handle async task.
10- Stages/component of promise
    there are stages of promise:
    -panding stage
    - rejected
    - fullfill

11- JavaScript code exeuction priority
  - sync code
  - promises 
  - callback async
12- How to handle reject errors in promises
    - use catch
13- What is promise chaining:
    Sometimes, you want to execute two or more related asynchronous 
    operations, where 
    the next operation starts with the result from the previous step

function generateNumber(num) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(num);
    }, 3 * 1000);
  });
}

generateNumber(10)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
    return generateNumber(result * 2);
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
    return generateNumber(result * 3);
  })
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
14- What is blocking vs non blocking code
    - Blocking refers to operations that block further execution 
    until that operation finishes
     while non-blocking refers to code that doesn't block execution

15- What is Promise.all, settled, any

16- What is async & await & how it's different from promises
    
17- What is .then & .catch
18- How a setTimeOut will be exeucting inside a promise
    
19- How to create async function in normal & arrow
    const func = async () => {
    const p11 = await Promise.all([p1(), p2(), p3(), p4(), p5()]).catch(
      (err) => {
        console.log(err);
      }
    );
    console.log(p11);
    const p22 = await Promise.allSettled([p1(), p2(), p3(), p4(), p5()]).catch(
      (err) => {
        console.log(err);
      }
    );
    console.log(p22);
    const p33 = await Promise.any([p1(), p2(), p3(), p4(), p5()]).catch(
      (err) => {
        console.log(err);
      }
    );
    console.log(p33);
  };
  func();
20- Can we use await without async:
    no , becuase await wait for completion of async task
21- An image tag loading an image sync or async
